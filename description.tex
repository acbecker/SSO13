\textbf{Option 1:}The primary goal of this proposal is to determine
the critical planetary radius between rocky and gaseous bodies from
\kepler~data. We will exploit the expected discrepancy in tidal
dissipation of gaseous and rocky bodies to determine the largest
orbital periods at which the two classes of bodies circularize. We
will use the so-called transit duration deviation, the difference
between the observed transit duration and that of a circular orbit, to
estimate the minimum eccentricity permitted from transit data. We will
also include the effects of additional planetary companions and
atmospheric mass loss, as they also influence the evolution of the
eccentricities. In order to successfully map these theoretical results
to \kepler~data, we require robust characterization of each candidate,
and hence we will perform state-of-the-art transit modeling of all
\kepler~transits. Our proposed research offers the best route to
determine which \kepler~candidates are rocky, independent of mass
measurements, vital information in \kepler's quest to discover
potentially habitable planets orbiting G dwarfs.

\textbf{Option 2:} The discovery of an inhabited planet is a primary
goal of exoplanetary science, if not astrophysics in general. The
\kepler~spacecraft has now found several small candidates in
potentially habitable orbits, e.g. Kepler-62 f; \cite{Borucki13}, and
radial velocity surveys are also detecting apparently low-mass planets
in the habitable zone (HZ), e.g. Gl 667C c
\cite{AngladaEscude12}. While the location of an orbit with respect to
the HZ is an important first cut, the composition of the planet is at
least as important. Life cannot survive on gaseous planets, yet we do
not know the mass and/or radius that separates gaseous from
terrestrial planets. In particular, the identification of the critical
radius between the two, $R_{crit}$, would provide crucial information
for \kepler's primary mission to discover a terrestrial planet in the
HZ of a G dwarf. {\bf We propose to exploit the observed minimum
  eccentricity, tidal theory, and a reanalysis of \kepler~data to
  determine $R_{crit}$, as well as constrain the tidal quality factors
  of both rocky and gaseous planets ($Q_r$ and $Q_g$, respectively),
  and the efficiency of hydrogen loss for close in small gaseous
  exoplanets in the \kepler~field.}

{\centerline{\ub{\sc Tidal Theory}}}
\smallskip

Tidal dissipation is celestial bodies in extremely challenging to
measure
\cite{GoldreichSoter66,Hut81,AksnesFranklin01,Jackson08a,Jackson09,Makarov12}
due to 1) the dearth of worlds in highly dissipative configurations,
2) the long timescales involved (Gyrs), and 3) the intractability of
derivations based on first principles. However, the \kepler~ space
telescope has discovered thousands of exoplanet candidates
\cite{Batalha12}, of which about 1000 orbit FGK stars with orbital
periods less than 10 days that may experience significant tidal
evolution \cite{Rasio96,Jackson08a,Matsumura10}. Thus, exoplanets hold
the potential to eliminate issue \#1.

In the equilibrium tide model
\cite{Darwin1880,Jeffries56,MacDonald64,GoldreichSoter66,Hut81,FerrazMello08,Leconte10},
the figure of a tidally deformed body is a superposition of surface
waves with different frequencies. The sum of these waves corresponds
to the tidally-deformed figure, and allows for the relatively simple
derivation of the time rates of change of orbital and spin
properties. While two qualitatively different models have emerged, the
constant-phase-lag (CPL) and constant-time-lag (CTL) model
\cite{Greenberg09}, both rely on this assumption, and neither has been
rejected observationally. Both models make a critical prediction that
we will exploit in this proposal: The tidal dissipation in rocky
planets is orders of magnitude larger than in gaseous bodies. This
disparity implies that rocky planets will evolve much more rapidly
than gaseous bodies and we expect rocky exoplanets to be tidally
circularized on larger orbits than for gaseous bodies. As we show
below, the canonical values for $Q_g$ of $10^6$ and $Q_r$ of 100
should be measurable in the \kepler~field, if the transit data and
stellar properties can be known to sufficient accuracy. The key is to
recognize that gaseous bodies will tidally circularize more slowly
than rocky planets, and may still retain non-zero eccentricities after
Gyrs. While transit data cannot measure the eccentricity
\cite{Barnes07}, they can provide a lower limit which we turn to now.

\medskip
{\centerline{\ub{\sc The Transit Duration Deviation}}}
\smallskip

The transit duration is the time required for a planet to traverse the
disk of its parent star, and to first order is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:duration}
T = \frac{\sqrt{R_*^2 - b^2}}{v},
\end{equation}
where $R_*$ is the radius of the star, $b$ is the impact parameter,
and $v$ is the instantaneous velocity of the planet. On a circular
orbit, $v$ is constant and we expect
\begin{equation}\label{eq:durcirc}
T_c = \frac{\sqrt{R_*^2 - b^2}}{\pi a}P,
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the orbital period. However, for an eccentric orbit the
orbital velocity is a function of longitude (Kepler's 3rd Law), and is
given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:velocity}
v(\theta) = \frac{2\pi a}{P}\sqrt{\frac{1 + 2e\cos(\theta) + e^2}{1-e^2}},
\end{equation}
where $e$ is the eccentricity and $\theta$ is the true anomaly, the
angle between the longitude of pericenter and the actual position of
the planet in its orbit. From transit data alone, the value of
$\theta$ is unknown, and hence so is $e$.

However, we can exploit the difference between $T$ and $T_c$ to obtain
a minimum value of the eccentricity, $e_{min}$, \cite{Barnes07}. The
situation is somewhat complicated because $T$ can be larger or smaller
than $T_c$ depending on $\theta$. If the planet is close to apoapse,
$T > T_c$, while at periapse $T < T_c$. To derive $e_{min}$ we must
assume that $\theta = 0$ or $\pi$. While the velocity could be larger
at some other position in the orbit, we know that the maximum
deviation from the circular velocity is at least as large as the
measured velocity, and hence $e$ must be at least a certain value. If
we define the transit duration deviation, $\Delta$, as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tdd}
\Delta = \begin{dcases} \frac{T-T_c}{T_c} & T_c < T \\ \frac{T_c - T}{T_c} & T_c > T, \end{dcases}
\end{equation}
and then for ease of notation,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:deltaprime}
\Delta' \equiv \begin{cases} \Delta + 1 & T_c < T \\ \Delta - 1 & T_c > T, \end{cases}
\end{equation}
then we find that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:emin}
e_{min} = \begin{dcases} \frac{\Delta'^2 - 1}{\Delta'^2 + 1} & T_c < T \\ \frac{1 - \Delta'^2}{1 + \Delta'^2} & T_c > T \end{dcases}
\end{equation}
is the minimum eccentricity permitted by transit data.

\medskip
{\centerline{\ub{\sc The Boundary Between Rocky and Gaseous Planets}}}
\smallskip

That transit data provide a minimum eccentricity while tidal theory
damps eccentricity to zero is crucial for our proposed research. If
$e_{min} = 0$, \textit{then the orbit is circular}. Of course circular
orbits could be primordial, but \cite{Jackson08a,Matsumura10} showed
that the observed radial-velocity-detected planets in tight orbits
could have formed with eccentricities consistent with the more distant
planets and were subsequently tidally damped in both the CPL and CTL
framework. If $e_{min} > 0$ then tides have not tidally damped the
eccentricity, and, if we know the age of the system, then we can
estimate the tidal $Q$, or its equivalent in the CTL model, the time
lag $\tau$.

As an example consider the two curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:compareQ}. Both
these planets begin with the same orbit around the same star. The line
shows 10 Gyr of tidal evolution of a 2~\rearth planet with a a density
of 1 g/cm$^3$ and a tidal $Q$ of $10^6$ (i.e. a 3.8~\mearth
``mini-Neptune''), while the filled circles are the orbit of a
2~\rearth planet with a mass of 10~\mearth and a tidal $Q$ of 100
(i.e. a ``super-Earth'') every 100 Myr. The super-Earth circularizes
in about 1 Gyr; the mini-Neptune is not even close, even after 10
Gyr. This discrepancy is despite that the equilibrium tidal models
predict evolution scales as mass to the 3/2 power and radius to the
fifth power, -- the large difference between the $Q$s dominates. We
therefore hypothesize that the TDD may be able to identify the radius
that separates gaseous planets from rocky planets.

\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{minipage}{2.7in}
\caption{\label{fig:compareQ}Comparison of the tidal evolution of a 2~\rearth
mini-Neptune (solid line; for 10 Gyr) and a 2~\rearth super-Earth (circles; in 100 Myr intervals). The mini-Neptune experiences little orbital evolution, but the super-Earth circularizes in about 1 Gyr. This discrepancy is due to the 4 orders of magnitude difference in tidal dissipation between gaseous and rocky planets.}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

To test this possibility, we performed the following test. We created
25,000 synthetic star-planet configurations with initial semi-major
axes uniformly in the range [0.01,0.1] AU, radii in the range
[0.5,10]~\rearth, stellar masses in the range [0.8,1.2]~\msun, and
ages in the range [2,8] Gyr. If the radius is less than 2~\rearth,
then the mass is ($R$/\rearth)$^{3.68}$\mearth~\cite{Sotin07} and we
assign a tidal $Q$ in the range [30,300]. If larger, then we assume
the density is 1 g/cm$^3$, and the tidal $Q$ is in the range
[$10^6$,$10^7$]. The initial eccentricity is drawn from the currently
observed distribution of distant planets ($a > 0.2$~AU). We then
integrate the system forward for the randomly chosen age and assume we
observe the system in that final configuration. In Fig.~\ref{fig:ecc},
we show the resulting average eccentricities of these planes as a
function of planetary radius, $R_p$, and orbital period, $P$. The
small values of $e$ at low $R_p$ and $P$ shows this
effect. Furthermore, we can see the features that correspond directly
to three parameters that are currently very poorly constrained:
$R_{crit}$ -- the rapid rise in $<e>$ at 2~\rearth; $Q_g$ the rapid
rise in $<e>$ at 1 day above 2~\rearth; and $Q_r$ -- the rapid rise at
4 days below 2~\rearth. Thus in this simple model, we see three
constraints for three unknowns and observations may be able to provide
values to these elusive quantities.

However, \kepler~data do not provide eccentricity, but rather the
minimum eccentricity. We must therefore transform these data into a
form that is directly comparable to an observable, e.g. $e_{min}$. In
order to calculate $e_{min}$, we choose a random value for $\theta$
and calculate the velocity according to Eq.~\ref{eq:velocity}. We
calculate the average minimum eccentricity, $<e_{min}>$ in
1~\rearth~planetary radius bins and 1 day orbital period bins and plot
$<e_{min}>$ as a function of orbital period for different radii as
solid lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:emin}. For $R < 2$~\rearth, $<e_{min}>
\sim 0$ up to about a 4 day period. However, for larger radii,
circular orbits are only guaranteed for periods less than about 2
days. \textit{Despite the order of magnitude ranges for each physical
  planetary property, the disparity in tidal $Q$'s produces a strong
  signal in $<e_{min}>$ that distinguishes the rocky and gaseous
  planets. }

  eccentricities if the period is larger than 1.5 days, whereas rocky
  planet periods must be larger than 4 days. Filled squares are the
  values for observed \kepler~planets as provided by JPL's

  gaseous planets as well as both types' tidal $Q$'s.}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

This pilot study is encouraging, but its feasibility rests on the
precision of \kepler~measurements. Specifically, impact parameters,
stellar and planetary radii, orbital period, and stellar mass must be
known and their uncertainties well-modeled. The first four properties
are measurable from transit data alone, the fifth must be estimated by
other means. The \kepler~team has provided these data in various
publications and websites. The solid squares show the values of
$<e_{min}>$ with quantities from the \kepler~Planet Candidate Data
Explorer\footnote{http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/kepler}. All the
observed data are above the predictions. There are two possible
explanations for this discrepancy: 1) The theory is wrong, or 2) the
data are of poor quality.

\medskip
{\centerline{\ub{\sc Non--Tidal Effects}}}
\smallskip

Before addressing the data analysis, we evaluate the theory. First, we
note that additional companions can pump eccentricity through mutual
gravitational interactions, even if tidal damping is ongoing
\cite{vanLaerhovenGreenberg13,Bolmont13}. Therefore we must be
cautious when interpreting Fig.~\ref{fig:pilot}, as additional
companions, both seen and unseen, can maintain non-zero
eccentricities. However, \cite{Bolmont13} showed that planet-planet
interactions cannot maintain 55 Cnc e's eccentricity above 0.1. That
system is particularly relevant as there are many close-in planets
orbiting a G dwarf. Therefore, we can conclude that discrepancy
between the observed and simulated systems is not due to planet-planet
interactions.

Another possibility is that stellar winds and activity can strip an
atmosphere, reducing the mass and radius, and potentially changing the
planet from a mini-Neptune to a super-Earth
\cite{Jackson10,Valencia10,Leitzinger11,Poppenhaeger12}. Recently,
\cite{OwenWu13} argued that the \kepler~sample is consistent with
hydrodyanmic mass loss, and that some low-mass planets could have
formed with substantially more mass. Mass loss should decrease the
time to circularize the orbit, assuming the radius doesn't become very
large, which is unlikely after about 100 Myr
\cite{Lopez12}. Therefore, mass loss could stall circularization for
mini-Neptunes, but not for super-Earths. Although few radial velocity
measurements exist, planets with radii less than $\sim 1.5$~\rearth~
have densities consistent with silicate compositions
\cite{Batalha10}. Thus, mass loss seems unlikely to explain the
discrepancy seen for the smallest candidates in the \kepler~field.

Other effects, such as stellar mass loss or the galactic tide will be
negligible, but to properly treat the problem, planetary mass loss and
planet-planet perturbations must be considered. On the theoretical
side, the path forward to determine $R_{crit}$, $Q_{r}$ and $Q_{g}$ is
clear: We must first model the full range of plausible values for
these three parameters to calculate $<e_{min}>$($R_p,P$). We must then
include the planet-planet interactions of multiple planet systems over
the lifetimes of the systems. Finally, we must incorporate mass loss,
including the possibility that a mini-Neptune can become a super-Earth
with its associated change in tidal $Q$.

In the following sections, we describe our research plan in more
detail. In Task A, we consider systems consisting of one star and one
planet. In Task B, we include multiple planet systems. In Task C, we
incorporate mass loss. 

\medskip
{\centerline{\ub{\sc Task A: Tides in Star-Planet Systems}}}
\smallskip

We begin with the simplest treatment, a single planet orbiting a
single star in an orbit that can be modified by tides. We will mostly
follow the procedure described for our pilot study, but will expand
the analysis to a broader range of initial conditions as well as
include alternative tidal models. The pilot study (25,000 simulations
of $\sim 5$ Gyr each) requires about 4 hours on a modern workstation,
and therefore many such trials are easily tractable. Co-I Barnes is an
expert in tidal effects on exoplanets
\cite{Barnes08,Jackson08a,Barnes09,Barnes12}, and will use his
existing code \texttt{eqtide} that follows the prescriptions in
\cite{Barnes12}. The free parameters are the mass-radius relationship
for both rocky and gaseous bodies, the value of $R_{crit}$, the the
$Q$'s of rocky and gaseous bodies, the initial eccentricity
distribution, and the age distribution of \kepler~stars.

The choices in the pilot study were arbitrary, and we will explore
many more options. While we assumed that rocky bodies were Earth-like
in their composition, other scaling laws are possible, e.g.
\cite{Seager07,Fortney07,Lissauer10}. We will use these other scalings
for the masses of the rocky planets, as well as mixing the models to
allow for a range of compositions. For the gaseous planets, we will
assume different densities in the range 0.5 -- 3 g/cm$^3$, and also
mixed cases where the density is chosen at random. The value of
$R_{crit}$ is the parameter we are most interested in, and we will
examine it finely, varying it from 1 to 2.5 \rearth in 0.1~\reath
intervals. We will consider two different models for $Q$($R$), the
tidal $Q$ as a function of planetary radius. First we will use the
same differences as in the pilot study, but we will also consider a
three-tiered model, in which intermediate mass planets have
intermediate $Q$s. Neptune, and possible even Saturn, have a $Q$ value
of $10^4$ \citep{Hamliton04,Makarov12}, and hence we must consider
this possibility, too. This also introduces a new radius cut-off,
$R_{mid}$, which we will allow to move from 2 to 5~\rearth. The $Q$
range for these systems will have values between 3000 and 30,000. We
will randomly choose a stellar mass in the range 0.7--1.4~\msun as we
are interested in FGK stars. A sentence on the age
distribution. Finally, we will keep the initial eccentricity
distribution consistent with that of more distant
exoplanets. Ultimately we expect to run several hundred of these
suites of systems, which is easily tractable on a modern multi-core
workstation.

The examples in Figs.~\ref{fig:compareQ}--\ref{fig:emin} used one
tidal model, in which the lag angle between the tidal bulge and the
perturber is constant regardless of frequency
\citep[e.g.][]{GoldreichSoter66,Jackson08}. Another popular model
assumes that lag angle is instead a function of frequency
\citep[e.g.][]{Hut81,Matsumura10}. We will also employ this model with
the same ranges as described above, and relating $Q$ to the time lag
$tau$ as $Q = 1/n\tau$, where $n$ is the mean motion, e.g.
\cite{Correia12}. In reality there is no general conversion between
the two, but this relation is in common use. Thus, our work may also
shed light on the frustrating ambiguity in determining the most
appropriate equilibrium tidal model.

\medskip
{\centerline{\ub{\sc Task B: Multi-planet Systems}}}
\smallskip


Many of the \kepler~systems are multiple, and probably many singletons
are, but with non-transiting companions. Mutual gravitational
interactions between planets can maintain an eccentricity, even in the
presence of strong tidal damping
\citep{AdamsLaughlin05,Correia12,vanLaerhovenGreenberg13}. While this
pumping cannot explain the discrepancy in Fig.~\ref{fig:emin}, it can
still prevent some planets from reaching $e_{min} = 0$, and lead to an
incorrect determination of $R_{crit}$. To assess this possibility, we
will perform simulations of multiplanet systems undergoing tidal
damping.

Ideally these simulations would couple an N-body integrator to the
tidal models, as the former can be very accurate. Unfortunately the
timescales are so long that such an approach is intractable. We
therefore must use classical secular theory in which the evolution for
Gyr can be computed in seconds. The second order theory is
insufficient for many of the cases we consider, which will have
eccentricities up to 0.9. Therefore, we will use higher order
theories, which have been previously developed
\citep[e.g.][]{Ford01,VerasArmitage04,LibertHenrard06}. We may also
take advantage of the high degree of coplanarity of close-in
\kepler~systems \cite{Fabrycky10}, and ignore all terms involving
inclination. As each of these models is computationally cheap, we can
safely use the 12th order theory of \cite{LibertHenrard} to evaluate
the evolution. This will probably double or triple the computation
time, but such a hit is acceptable, in order to ensure a proper
treatment of the problem.

More challenging is the choice of initial conditions. While many
\kepler~systems are multiple, we do not yet know the underlying
distribution of orbital architectures. A full exploration of parameter
space with arbitrary multiplicity and orbital elements would be
intractable, and would be very challenging to interpret. We therefore
will limit our study to suites of 25,000 systems with multiplicity
that follows from the observations. Furthermore, we will limit the
size of our planetary systems to $<0.5$ AU. More distant companions
could certainly affect the orbits of close-in companions, but the more
distant companions may also be on inclined orbits, as demonstrated by
$\upsilon$ Andromedae c and d
\citep{McArthur10,ReffertQuirrenbach11}. Therefore, to ease both the
computational burden, and not to diverge too far into unconstrained
parameter space, we will use these constraints. The physical
properties of the planets will be in the same ranges as above. Co-I
Barnes has experience with secular theory
\citep{BarnesGreenberg06a,BarnesGreenberg06b}, and hence will lead
this effort. We will perform numerical tests of stability of initial
conditions, and will throw out systems that divergently cross strong
mean motion resonances, such 2:1, 3:1, and 3:2, that lead to system
break-up \citep[e.g.][]{Gomes05}.

Additionally, it is likely that many of the close-in systems cannot
have initial eccentricities comparable to the non-tidally-evolved
planets because they would be unstable. In those cases, the orbits are
probably close to their primordial morphologies and experience
migration during the protoplanetary disk phase. Recently
\cite{DawsonMurrayClay13} showed compelling evidence that high
metallicity stars are more likely to host eccentric
planets. Therefore, we will make two comparisons with the
\kepler~sample: the full set and the high metallicity set. Although
this decreases our statistical robustness, it may be the most
appropriate comparison.

\medskip
{\centerline{\ub{\sc Task C: Atmospheric Mass Loss}}}
\smallskip

In addition to tidal evolution, close-in exoplanets can also
experience mass loss as high energy radiation can liberate hydrogen
\citep{Watson81,VidalMadjar04}. \cite{Jackson10} showed that mass loss
and tidal evolution are coupled for the case of CoRoT-7 b and that
both positive and negative feedbacks are possible. Mass loss is
especially important in our study as a planet could transition from a
gaseous body to a rocky body during its lifetime, leading to a
two-speed evolution.

We will employ the classic mass loss of model of \cite{Watson81} in
which XUV photons liberate hydrogen atoms in the upper
atmosphere. Mass loss can be a very complicated process
\citep{Yelle04,Lammer07,Khodachenko07,Lammer10,Leitzinger11}, and with
so many unknowns for any given planet, this simple model is most
appropriate. The key parameter in this formulation is the efficiency
of transforming incident XUV radiation into escaping atoms,
$\epsilon$. Most studies of hot Jupiter place $\epsilon$ in the range
0.1 -- 0.4. We will therefore explore a range of 0.05 -- 0.5 in
increment of 0.05 and apply these to the configurations of Task A and
Task B. For the XUV flux, we will use the empirical relationship
derived in \cite{Ribas05} for G dwarfs. While this formulation is not
strictly valid for F and K dwarfs, analogous studies do not exist for
those spectral types, and the Ribas \etal model is probably a close
approximation. The Watson \etal and Ribas \etal models are already in
\texttt{eqtide} \citep{Barnes12}, and hence minimal code improvements
are required for this step. This final theoretical task requires about
2--3 times more computational resources than the other two combined,
but is still dwarfed by the \kepler~analysis, and can easily be
completed within a few months on a workstation, or on UW's local
supercomputer.

Unfortunately the inclusion of mass loss leads to a degeneracy in our
model. The three parameters we previously discussed, $R_{crit}$, $Q_r$
and $Q_g$, are all related to features in Fig.~[plot of $<e>$ as a
  function of radius and period, that figure I showed you long
  ago]. Mass loss complicates the picture by blurring these
boundaries. On the other hand, it is entirely possible that we will
fail to reproduce the observed $<e_{min}>$ distribution without it. At
the conclusion of Task C, we will have about 2000 suites of
simulations with different physical parameters to compare to the
\kepler~planet candidates. If we succeed in identifying $R_{crit}$,
then planets found in the HZ of \kepler~targets can be characterized
as gaseous or rocky (and potentially habitable), independent of
knowledge of their masses.

{\centerline{\ub{\sc Transit Duration}}}
\smallskip

What is this definition?  Center of planet crossing?

\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta t_{circ} & = & {{P}\over{\pi}}~{{\sqrt{R_*^2 - b_0^2}}\over{a}} \nonumber \\
                & = & {{P}\over{\pi}}~{{\sqrt{1 - \beta_0^2}}\over{\alpha}}
\label{eq-tcirc}
\end{eqnarray}
where $P$ is the orbital period in cgs units, $R_*$ the stellar radius
in cgs, $b_0$ the minimum planetary impact parameter in cgs, $\beta_0$
a unitless measure of the minimum impact parameter (scaled by the
stellar radius), $a$ the planetary semi--major axis in cgs, and
$\alpha$ this value scaled by the stellar radius.


\medskip
{\centerline{\ub{\sc Fitted Transit Model}}}
\smallskip

To avoid a dependency between the fitted model and a physical model
that includes orbital dynamics, we parameterize the fitted lightcurve
in purely geometric terms.  To do so, we adopt the quadratic
limb--darkened model of \cite{2002ApJ...580L.171M}, which describes
transit lightcurves in terms of two (nuisance) limb--darkening
coefficients and two (important) system parameters.  The first of the
system parameters is the planetary radius divided by the stellar
radius ($\zeta \equiv Rp/R_*$), which determines the fractional area
of the stellar disk that may be occulted by the planet.  The second is
the impact parameter of the planet ($\beta \equiv b/R_*$).  This
variable is a function of time due to the objects' relative motion.
This function is dependent on the chord that the planet takes across
the stellar disk, itself typically estimated using the orbital
parameters semi--major axis and inclination.

Instead we use here a purely geometric parameterization, represented
in Figure~\ref{fig-schem}.  We describe the impact parameter as a
function of time using the minimum impact parameter $\beta_0$ -- when
the centers of the sources are aligned along the x--axis at
center--of--transit time $t_0$ -- and the location of the planet on
the transit chord across the stellar disk.  The x--coordinate of the
planet as a function of time is represented as $x(t) / R_* = (t - t_0)
* v_\perp / R_* = (t - t_0) / \tau$, where $v_\perp$ is the (unknown)
perpendicular velocity, and $\tau$ is the (fitted) amount of time it
takes the planet to traverse a distance equal to the stellar radius
assuming no acceleration.  This allows us to express geometrically the
impact parameter as a function of time:
\begin{eqnarray}
\beta(t) & = & \sqrt{\beta_0^2 + \left((t - t_0) / \tau\right)^2},
\end{eqnarray}
which is then used along with $\zeta$ to generate a model transit
lightcurve.

The transit duration $\Delta t$ may be found from the 2 solutions to
$\beta(t) = 1$, and represents the time between the center of the
planet crossing each limb of the star:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta t & = & 2 * \tau \sqrt{1 - \beta_0^2}.
\label{eq-dt}
\end{eqnarray}
This model yields a 4--parameter fit to each transit: $t_0, \beta_0^2,
\tau, \zeta$.  The system period $P$ may be determined using the
ensemble of $t_{0;i=1...N}$.

Combining Equation~\ref{eq-dt} with Equation~\ref{eq-emin}, we express
$e_{min}$ in terms of our model parameters:
\begin{eqnarray}
e_{min} & = & \pm \frac{P^{2} - 4 \pi^{2} \alpha^{2} \tau^{2}}{P^{2} + 4 \pi^{2} \alpha^{2} \tau^{2}}
\label{eq-emin2}
\end{eqnarray}
All factors of the minimum impact parameter $\beta_0$ cancel out,
which is fortuitous as this is typically the least constrained of all
system parameters, especially for the long--cadence \kepler data.
While the uncertainty in $\beta_0$ will affect our knowledge of the
other system parameters, this uncertainty may be marginalized out by
examining the posterior distributions, and drives us to use
Markov--Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modeling (described below).

Equation~\ref{eq-emin2} indicates that $e_{min}$ is purely a function
of the fitted parameter $\tau$, the derived period $P$, and an assumed
semi--major axis for the planet (in units of the stellar radius)
$\alpha$.  The uncertainty in $e_{min}$ scales as below for all 3
parameters:

\begin{eqnarray}
\Xi & \equiv & \frac{16 \pi^{2} \alpha^{2} \tau^{2} P^{2}}{16 \pi^{4} \alpha^{4} \tau^{4} - P^{4}} \\
\frac{\delta e_{min}}{\delta \xi} & = & \frac{\Xi~e_{min}}{\xi} ~~~~~ \left[\xi = \tau; P; \alpha \right].\nonumber
\label{eq-emin3}
\end{eqnarray}
In the limit of a circular orbit ($P \rightarrow 2 \pi \alpha \tau$),
$\Xi~e_{min}$ = 1.

\rory{Describe the fake systems}

We use the system inclination, semi--major axis, planet--to--star
radius ratio, and period (along with two limb darkening parameters) to
generate fake system lightcurves using the method of
\cite{2002ApJ...580L.171M}.  The system lightcurve is evaluated once
each minute and integrated over 30 evaluations to approximate a single
\kepler long--cadence observation.  This is done for a window of 1 day
on either side of the given transit midpoint to ensure significant
out--of--transit data to include in the fit.  We perform these
evaluations for all transits for 14 ``quarters'' of \kepler
observations, or approximately 1280 days.

A white--noise component is added to each lightcurve for each of 4
magnitude bins, using the precisions in parts--per--million (ppm)
given on the \kepler calibration
webpage \footnote{http://keplergo.arc.nasa.gov/CalibrationSN.shtml}.
We evaluate each lightcurve separately for magnitude 8/10/12/14
objects, adding a random contribution of amplitude 11.3/29/80/296 ppm
(respectively) to each datapoint as generated above.  We do not
include red noise, or other transient gaps and features known to exist
in the \kepler data.  This yields a set of 4 lightcurves per simulated
system, each having hundreds of individual transits to fit.

\medskip
{\centerline{\ub{\sc KOI 701.01}}}
\smallskip

We validate the results of our simulations by analyzing \kepler data
from KOI 701.01 \citep[Kepler 62--b;][]{2013arXiv1304.7387B}.  This
planet has a period of 5.715 days, $\zeta = 0.018$ (R$_p$ $\sim$ 1.3
R$_E$), and a transit depth of $4 \times 10^{-4}$~\%.  We use the limb
darkening parameters for the host star from
\cite{2010A&A...510A..21S}.  The \kepler data have correlated noise
that is not included in our simulated data above, which is an
additional complication to the analysis.  To account for this, we
perform a local detrending by first dividing the data by the proposed
model, and fitting a low order spline to the result.  The goodness of
fit is determined by comparing the product of the spline and the model
to the data.  Figure~\ref{fig-koi70101} provides an example model fit
determined in this manner.  The data used are the {\tt PDCSAP} fluxes
and uncertainties.

      generated by first dividing the data by the transit model,

{\centerline{\ub{\sc Model Evaluation}}}
\smallskip

To examine how our knowledge of system parameters evolves as a
function of number of transits, we have fit {\it all} the data up to
the time of each transit, for all $N$ transits in each lightcurve.
This means that for transit $n \leq N$, we have common model
parameters $\beta_{0}^2, \tau, \zeta$ and per--transit parameters
$t_{0;i=1..n}$, for a total of $n+3$ model parameters.  This yields an
ensemble of $N$ system models per lightcurve, each incorporating one
more transit than the previous one.

We use the affine--invariant MCMC sampler {\tt emcee}
\citep{2013PASP..125..306F} to sample the posterior distribution of
the model parameters.  This program uses the method of
\cite{Goodman-Weare} to achieve high sampling performance independent
of the aspect ratio of the posterior distribution, meaning covariances
between parameters are less important to the efficacy of the MCMC
sampling.  This provides a set of MCMC chains that we examine to
determine our constraints on the fitted parameters.  We use the
Gelman--Rubin $\hat{\rm R}$--static \citep{Gelman92} to assure that
each chain sufficiently samples model space, and require effective
chain lengths larger than $10^4$ to ensure sufficient mixing in the
MCMC sample \cite[e.g.][]{2004PhRvD..69j3501T}.  Our trial runs using
KOI 701.01 indicate that our chains typically have autocorrelation
lengths of $\sim 100$, requiring a total number of steps per chain of
$10^6$.  We use burn--in times having 10\% the requested number of
steps, which are then discarded before the final chain commences.

For each transit, we evaluate the joint and marginalized distributions
of $\zeta$ and $\tau$.  Figure~\ref{fig-joint} demonstrates how the
joint distribution evolves from fitting 1 transit (dashed contours,
which represent 68.3\%, 95.5\%, and 99.7\% confidence limits), to
fitting all transits (solid contours, at the same confidence limits),
for KOI 701.01.  We then marginalize over all other parameters, and
examine the per--parameter confidence limits.  Figure~\ref{fig-marg}
demonstrates how our marginalized constraints on $\zeta$ (left panel)
and $\tau$ (right panel) evolve as a function of the number of
transits used in the fit for 701.01.  The solid line provides the
maximum of the posterior distribution, and the dashed line indicates
its median.  The shaded area encloses 68.3\% of the distribution.  In
this way we quantify $\delta \tau$, as this is necessary to understand
our ability to constrain $e_{min}$ via Equation~\ref{eq-emin3}.

To examine our constraints on the system period, we use the
$t_{0;1..n}$ posterior distributions from the fits described above.
We use {\tt emcee} to sample the posterior space of (nuisance
parameter) $t_{0;1}$ and period $P$.  For a given trial ($t_{0;1}, P$)
pair, the likelihood is determined through:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{L}(t_{0;1}, P) & = & \prod_{i=1}^{i=n} \kappa_i(t_{0;1} + P * (i-1))
\end{eqnarray}
where $\kappa_i$ is a kernel density estimate of each posterior
distribution $t_{0;i}$, which is evaluated at the predicted time of
transit $t_0 + P * (i-1)$.  By modeling the times of transit
separately in the original MCMC analysis, we open the possibility of
using a more complex ephemeris model at this stage of the analysis,
such as may be expected from transit timing variations
\citep{2005MNRAS.359..567A,2005Sci...307.1288H}.  The results of this
analysis for KOI 701.01 are presented in Figure~\ref{fig-period}.

      posteriors ($t_{0;i=1..n}$) evaluated at the predicted transit
      time $t_0 + P * i$, where $t_0$ is the (marginalized over) time

{\centerline{\ub{\sc Kepler Sample Available for Analysis}}}
\smallskip

We need systems that are observed with the short cadence (ummm, maybe
not since we marginalize over $\beta_0$), are bright enough to resolve
$e_{min}$ to within 0.1, and have short period planets (less than 4
days).  From this sample, we will need to know the physical
characteristics of stellar mass and radius, and (ideally) age.

The detailed \cite{2013arXiv1304.7387B} analysis of Kepler 62--b
results in an $e_{min}$ value of $0.022 \pm 0.005$.  Contrasting this
value with distribution of publicly available data in
Figure~\ref{emin} indicates that this project {\it requires} a
complete re--analysis of relevant systems.

\medskip
{\centerline{\ub{\sc Computational Requirements}}}
\smallskip

Using KOI 701.01 as a benchmark, we find a roughly quadratic
relationship for the total {\tt emcee} computation time vs the number
of transits: $time(n) = -12.5 + 32.2 \times n + 11.9 \times n^2$
seconds (on a single 2.13 GHz core).  This relationship was
established using a fixed number of 100 burn--in and 1000 ``final''
steps for each of $2 \times n + 6$ walkers (i.e. 2 walkers for each
parameter in the model).  If we scale these chains up to $10^6$ total
steps, which should yield effective chain lengths of $\sim 10^4$, we
find a linear relationship in the computation time required to reach
$10^6$ steps: $time_{10^6}(n) = -1105 + 5943 \times n$ seconds.  For a
typical short--period system having 500 transits, this comes out to
approximately 35 CPU--days of analysis.  The {\tt emcee} code is
natively able to use multiprocessing capabilities, making this trivial
to implement on a multi--core system.  However, with {\tt XXX} systems
on our analysis path, this will require {\tt YYY} CPU--years of
computation, requiring the use of NASA's High-End Computing (HEC)
facilities.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{VI. Project Development Plan}
\smallskip

PI Becker will be technical lead the project for the first 1.5 years,
which will constitute the data analysis (MCMC) portion of the project.
He will work at 50\% FTE with the graduate student to implement the
computations on the \kepler sample of data.  Co--I Barnes will serve as
technical lead for the project for the second 1.5 years, as the
project transitions from analysis of the data to interpretation and
constraints on tidal evolution theory.  Co--I Agol has significant
experience in dealing with the \kepler data, including implementing
detrending algorithms to correct for correlated noise in the \kepler
data.  He will advise as--needed throughout the project.  PI Becker
will serve as the project lead throughout.

We regard the professional development of students as an important
responsibility of {\it any} research project.  In this regard, the
graduate students funded by this proposal will have the opportunity to
attend at least one relevant conference each year, and encouraged to
give oral presentations on our work.  This will become a requirement
as the project progresses.  We expect the graduate student to become
an expert in both areas of this project, both the
computational/modeling side and the theoretical side.  This student
will receive a strong dose of both data and theory, which is a
powerful combination and one not seen often enough in the field.  We
consider this dual--aspect training a strong component of this
project.

{\bf Year 1 (2014):} This first year of the project will start with PI
Becker bringing the student up to speed in modeling transit
lightcurves, in leaning Bayesian techniques, and in implementing a
robust application of the {\tt emcee} package (or other
affine--invariant sampler, if needed).  Making the software robust to
detrending errors, missing data, and initial conditions for the
samplers is a non--trivial exercise.  Discovering and understanding
the failure modes will be a main focus of this first
computationally--intensive first year.  Becker will lead this effort,
and transition the student into lead during the year.  The generation
of the MCMC chains is expected to take {\tt XXX} CPU--hours, or {\tt
  YYY} calendar--hours on {\tt ZZZ}. The validation of these chains
(Gelman--Rubin $\hat{\rm R}$ and effective chain lengths) is expected
to take a comparable amount of time, as some chains are expected to
have to be re--run or extended.  The goal of this first year is to
have finalized the MCMC chains on $t_0, \beta_0^2, \tau, \zeta$ for
all transits of all KOIs.  We will make these publicly available
through a {\tt github} site specifically designed for this project.
Our modeling software will also be released via {\tt github}.

{\bf Year 2 (2015):} The second year is expected to begin with the
MCMC analyses of the periods via times of transit, and transition to
theoretical interpretation of the systems.  We will start with linear
ephemeris models for all systems to estimate periods; for those
systems where this model is insufficient, we will examine transit
timing models with more complicated ephemerides.  We anticipate that
this effort will result in the publication of 1 or more ancillary
papers on the transit timings of the systems under study, with
assistance from Agol on the interpretation of the results.  We then
hand off to \rory{XXX}.
