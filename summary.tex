\centerline{\bf mini--Neptune vs. super--Earth: Orbital Eccentricity as a Proxy for Internal Structure} \medskip

We propose to combine a Bayesian reanalysis of short-period Kepler
exoplanet transits with standard models of tidal theory in order to
identify the planetary radius that separates rocky and gaseous
exoplanets. We exploit the conventional assumption that gaseous
planets dissipate orders of magnitude less tidal energy than rocky
planets, leading to the expectation that the latter will be on
circular orbits out to larger orbital periods. Preliminary dynamical
simulations show that short period (2-10 days) gaseous bodies tend to
be found with eccentricities near their primordial value, but rocky
bodies are preferentially found at low eccentricity due to tidal
circularization.  Thus, a study of the eccentricities of short-period
planets can constrain the planetary radius of this transition.  The
identification of the boundary between rocky and gaseous bodies,
independetly from mass measurements, will be vital for for Kepler's
long-term goal of discovering a habitable planet around a solar
analogue.

A lower limit to the orbital eccentricity can be calculated by
comparing the difference between the modeled transit duration and the
transit duration that would be seen if the orbit were circular.  To
assess this difference, we analyze Kepler lightcurves using a purely
geometric model that includes no assumptions about the orbital
dynamics.  We cast our measurement of minimum eccentricity in terms of
two model parameters, whose posterior distributions we explore using
Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and one physical parameter that must
be estimated from other means.  We will run a suite of simulations
using a grid in transit depth, stellar brightness (lightcurve
signal-to-noise), and the number of transits included in the model.

We validated this method on the confirmed exoplanet system Kepler 62-b
and successfully recovered the published results. We propose here to
extend this analysis to an ensemble of KOIs that have been selected
based upon their Kepler-reported periods and planetary radius, and
which have supporting information on the host star density and age.
This reanalysis will enable the first measurements of the boundary
between gaseous and rocky exoplanets, as well as tidal dissipation as
a function of planetary radius.

This project spans the fields of high-performance computation,
statistical modeling of experimental data, and celestial mechanics,
which will make it a valuable contribution to the field of exoplanet
studies.  We will release code and data using open-source
collaboration tools, and help to guide the adoption of reproducible
research standards by releasing analysis packages as part of our
publication process.
